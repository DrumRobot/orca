/**
 * A freshly launched agent's own composer-ready signal, as evidence for a launch-readiness wait.
 *
 * `tui-idle` alone never settles for an agent that paints no idle title and no known ready screen
 * (goose), so a launch prompt, a worker brief or a startup draft waited out its whole budget and was
 * never delivered. Each agent declares the evidence its composer gives (`launchReadiness` in
 * `tui-agent-config.ts`), backed by a captured screen; this reads it with the scanner the draft paste
 * has always used and hands its state to the tui-idle evaluator, which decides, including the
 * rendered-screen blocked check. An undeclared agent gets no watch and a plain `tui-idle` wait.
 *
 * The signal only counts while the agent owns the PTY. The shell arms bracketed paste for its own
 * prompt, so the scanner is fed only output between the shell's OSC 133;C (command started) and its
 * next 133;D / 133;A (command finished / prompt drawn). Outside that window the watch reads
 * `unowned`, and the wait is exactly `tui-idle`.
